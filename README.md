- The Project Is Predicting wheter a person has Heart Disease or not by using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms

- I taken the data from kaggle of Heat Diseaes <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci">Link</a>

- Did the Analysis on the data and found best ML algorithm to apply for the project

- Now I developed Webpage for User to enter his data and get Prediction

- index.html is the first file which will be shown to the user
-  different html pages refer to buttons in the website 
-  I used Flask so every button click will redirect to the template of html
-  prediction.py is the main html file which will take the user inputs and displays the result using result.html and result1.html pages
